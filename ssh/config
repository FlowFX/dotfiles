# (Stolen from https://github.com/scy/dotfiles/blob/master/.ssh/config)
# Load additional configs in ~/.ssh/config.d. These are host-specific configs.
# Hosts that I want to keep private are in
# files that are not added to Git, at least not to _this_ repository. Since
# OpenSSH uses the _first_ value it finds,
# host-specific things should come at the beginning, fallbacks towards the end
# of the file.
# `Include` is available since OpenSSH 7.3p1.
